# SERENE: Smart Emotional Response & Empathetic Neurotech Enhancer



---

## Overview

Mental health is essential for managing stress, maintaining healthy relationships, and making sound decisions. However, increasing academic, professional, and social pressures, along with digital overload, have contributed to rising levels of anxiety and burnout. Many individuals face barriers such as stigma, high costs, and limited access to timely support.

**SERENE** addresses this critical gap by providing an intelligent, real-time, and personalized mental health companion. Using advanced multi-modal emotion recognition through facial expressions, voice analysis, and speech content, SERENE accurately detects emotional states and delivers empathetic, context-aware support.

## Key Features

- **Multi-modal Emotion Analysis**  
  Real-time analysis of facial expressions (via ResNet50 and LSTM models) and voice tone for precise emotional understanding.

- **Intelligent Conversational Memory**  
  Remembers user preferences, emotional patterns, and past conversations to provide personalized and meaningful responses.

- **Personalized Well-being Recommendations**  
  Suggests guided relaxation techniques, mood-based activities, affirmations, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-inspired interventions.

- **Crisis Detection and Response**  
  Identifies signs of intense distress and immediately provides access to mental health resources, emergency contacts, or therapy suggestions.

- **Seamless Voice Interaction**  
  Integrated speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules for natural, smooth user interactions.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sathyajitanand2004/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
````

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file and add any necessary configuration keys (API keys, secret tokens, etc.).

### Pull Large Files (if using Git LFS)

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

### Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

1. **Capture and Analyze**
   Facial expressions and voice signals are captured and processed using advanced deep learning models.

2. **Emotional State Assessment**
   Emotion detection modules assess the user's current state in real time, integrating cues from multiple modalities.

3. **Context-Aware Response Generation**
   The memory agent maintains conversation history and emotional patterns to generate personalized, empathetic responses.

4. **Well-being Support and Crisis Intervention**
   The system provides tailored suggestions to improve mood or offers immediate resources in critical situations.
