## 💡 Overview

Mental health is essential for managing stress, maintaining healthy relationships, and making sound decisions. However, increasing academic, professional, and social pressures, combined with digital overload, have contributed to rising levels of anxiety and burnout. Many individuals face barriers such as stigma, high costs, and limited access to timely support.

**SERENE** bridges this critical gap by providing an intelligent, real-time, and personalized mental health companion. Using advanced multi-modal emotion recognition through facial expressions, voice analysis, and speech content, SERENE accurately detects emotional states and delivers empathetic, context-aware support.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎭 **Multi-modal Emotion Analysis**  
  Real-time analysis of facial expressions (via ResNet50 and LSTM models) and voice tone for precise emotional understanding.

- 💬 **Intelligent Conversational Memory**  
  Remembers user preferences, emotional patterns, and past conversations to provide personalized and meaningful responses.

- 🌿 **Personalized Well-being Recommendations**  
  Suggests guided relaxation techniques, mood-based activities, affirmations, and CBT-inspired interventions.

- ⚠️ **Crisis Detection & Response**  
  Identifies signs of intense distress and immediately provides access to mental health resources, emergency contacts, or therapy suggestions.

- 🗣 **Seamless Voice Interaction**  
  Integrated speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules for natural, smooth user interactions.

## ⚡ How It Works

1. **Capture & Analyze**
   Facial expressions and voice signals are captured and processed using advanced deep learning models.

2. **Emotional State Assessment**
   Emotion detection modules assess the user's current state in real time, integrating cues from multiple modalities.

3. **Context-Aware Response Generation**
   Memory agent maintains conversation history and user emotional patterns to craft personalized, empathetic responses.

4. **Well-being Support & Crisis Intervention**
   System provides tailored suggestions to improve mood, or offers immediate resources in critical situations.
